# BehaviourStack

A program that tracks emotion, age, and gender to gather insight on which advertisement techniques are more effective to certain target audiences, and automatically sends an email with a formatted statistics report based on the results. This program was built at the University of Ryerson for RUHacks 2019. Due to time contraints, open-source code and pretrained models were used to gather demographics.
